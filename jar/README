This is the directory for distribution packages.

Each package name is constructed out of the package name "jta", the
version "20" and the date of its creation. Each of the compiled class
file package names then additionally contains the name of the jdk
that was used to compile the java sources.

Examples:

A jar binary package compiled with the JDK 1.1.7B (Linux)
	jta20-19990911-1.1.7B.jar

The same binary package created with the JDK 1.2 (Linux)
	jta20-19990911-1.2.jar

The appended -src indicated a source package (no compiled files!)
	jta20-19990911-src.jar
